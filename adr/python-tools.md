# Setup tools

Click CLI commands can integrate with your shell to provide features like tab-completion. This is supported with setup tools, but does not appear to work with poetry. In this case the tab completion is more useful that the benefits of using Poetry for this project, and I cann't justify the time to investigate this further.

See <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/#enabling-completion>
